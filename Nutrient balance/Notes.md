## Nutrient requirements

__Nutrient uptake requirement__</br>
is expressed in ($kg_{nutrient}*ha_{-1}$), is the amount of a nutrient that must be absorbed in aboveground crop biomass to realize a certain target yield $Y^T$ ($kg*ha_{-1}$).

__Nutrient input requirement__</br>
$A^T$, is the amount of a nutrient applied per season, which supplements soil nutrients.</br>

$$
A^T=Y^T*AE^{EQ}
$$

$AE^{EQ}$ is also called agronomic efficiency, which indicates $kg$ yield per $kg$ nutrient applied. The efficiency could be decomposed into two components:</br>
$$
AE^{EQ} = IE^{EQ}*RE^{EQ}
$$

$IE^{EQ}$ is the extra yield per unit of nutrient uptake;</br>
$RE^{EQ}$ is the extra unit nutrient uptake per unit of nutrient input.</br>
