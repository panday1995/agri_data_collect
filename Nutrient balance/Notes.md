# Nutrient requirements

__Nutrient uptake requirement__</br>
is expressed in ($kg_{nutrient}*ha_{-1}$), is the amount of a nutrient that must be absorbed in aboveground crop biomass to realize a certain target yield $Y^T$ ($kg*ha_{-1}$).

__Nutrient input requirement__</br>
_A_<sup>T</sup>, is the amount of a nutrient applied per season, which supplements soil nutrients.</br>

$$
A^T=Y^T*AE^{EQ}
$$

$AE^{EQ}$ is also called agronomic efficiency. The efficiency could be decomposed into two components</br>
$$
AE^{EQ} = IE^{EQ}*RE^{EQ}
$$
